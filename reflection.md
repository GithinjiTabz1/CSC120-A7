- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?


Inheritance makes a programmer's work much easier. Instead of rewriting the same code, you can extend existing classes, making the code more efficient and reusable.


- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Starting the assignment early was incredibly helpful. Breaking it into small chunks each day reduced frustration and made the process more manageable.

For anyone taking this course in the future, Iâ€™d strongly recommend starting the assignment on the day it is assigned, if possible. Getting an early start allows more time for refining and troubleshooting, making the experience much smoother.
